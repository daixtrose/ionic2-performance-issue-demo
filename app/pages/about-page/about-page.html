    This is a demo showing a performance problem with Ionic 2 
  </p>

  <p>
    We have some Gauges which plot using the JustGage plot library and we have a y-t plot. Bot plot types a fed with a data stream from an observable. 
    Both plots are designed to update only every 250 ms. One uses Rx.sample the other a task to update the drawings. 
    If both plots are visible at the same time, we encounter a performance problem (the sinus slows down). 

    Why?
